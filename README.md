# NextCapital Bowling Jackpot
This is my submission for the NextCapital coding assignment during November 2015.<br />

The app will be a simple way for a bowling league to track a progressive jackpot. Bowlers in the league can buy tickets to enter the drawing. All tickets cost $10 dollars, and the proceeds go into the jackpot. After some tickets are bought, one ticket is drawn at random. The owner of that ticket gets to roll once. If they get a strike, they win the entire pot. Otherwise, they win a fraction of the pot, and the remaining pot rolls over into the next drawing.
